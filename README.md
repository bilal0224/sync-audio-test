# Sync-Audio

## Server software requirements

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com)
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org)

## Running the website

- Install the above libraries
- Clone the project
- In the project's root folder run `node index.js`

You may want to use something like [Forever](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forever) instead of executing the `node` command. It will ensure that the server automatically restarts after a failure.
